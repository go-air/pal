# pal

pal -- pointer analysis library for Go

See [this blog post](https://go-air.github.io/blog/20210729-pal.html)
for an overview.

## status: volatile prototype

pal is in a volatile prototyping stage.  We have re-organised 
things a few times already, and there are many sizeable holes
still to be coded.

We will use v0.0.X semtags for this stage of development,
and move to v0.1.X when the whole chain works together 
well enough to be used by others on our tests.

## roadmap
