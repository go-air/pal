# ‚äß pal

pal -- pointer analysis library for Go

See [this blog post](https://go-air.github.io/blog/20210729-pal.html)
for an overview.

## status: volatile prototype

pal is in a volatile prototyping stage.  We have re-organised 
things a few times already, and there are many sizeable holes
still to be coded.

We will use v0.0.X semtags for this stage of development,
treating it as "pre-alpha".  We will move to v0.1.X when the whole chain runs 
on our own tests, well enough to be used by others in alpha testing.
