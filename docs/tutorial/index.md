# pal tutorial

Welcome to the pal tutorial.  We hope to get you up and running quickly.  We give an overview/quick start for command line use and library use.

It is much easier to understand the command line use.

## CLI

Pal comes with a command line interface that
can be launched on packages in much the same way
as other static analysis tools such as 'go vet' and 'staticcheck'.

## Library

### Prerequisites

To understand how to use the pal library, we assume at a minimum an understanding of the Go
packages "go/types" and "go/packages".  

To understand how to use pal with the go analysis library and framework, we assume a basic understanding of "golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis".

As our first IR is "golang.org/x/tools/go/ssa", we recommend taking a look at that package as well.
